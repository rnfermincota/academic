More public and private organizations are looking for practical advice and solutions to enable a more effective adoption of data science and for the opportunity to recruit best-in-class talent for their needs in real-assets investments. Institutional investors, like Brookfield and GIC, have already adopted the use of real-assets related strategies in their portfolios at a rapidly increasing rate in recent years. As the markets themselves have grown commensurately to multi-billion size, real assets investing has become difficult to ignore. This creates tremendous opportunity, but it has implications for how we think about enabling technological and operational excellence. Due to the speed with which the institutional investment landscape and the way learning is changing, data scientists will always need to skill, reskill, and upskill. 

I have taught some financial models and data engineering methods I have developed during ten+ years of experience in private markets investing. My experience is that younger data scientists find real estate and infrastructure investments difficult to model and struggle to get their arms around the formulations. In class, I provide technical reports, work through the formulas and, for those interested, code to automate some of the calculations (https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/ppp_water_utility). Each case is exceptionally detailed allowing for separate macroeconomic, operational, capital asset and financial assumptions (https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/main/research/real_assets/). In addition, Karl Polen, Chief Investment Officer at the Arizona State Retirement System, has been kind enough to teach a guest lecture https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rnfc_dcf-results-in-shiny-activity-6716419259473498112-Wru7/, where students walk away with recipes, tips, and tricks to deploy cash flow models, and interactive dashboards to develop a competitive edge in real assets investing.

One of the unique aspects of the modeling framework taught in class is how user friendly and intuitive it is to use (https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/main/research/real_assets/0_real_estate/read_me_first.pdf). It follows a simple top-down approach where students can go through and input the various assumptions for each section as they have the information available. The technical report first explains how each index fits into the model as a whole and then gives detailed explanations of all formulas in plain English (https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/blob/main/research/real_assets/0_real_estate/technical_report.pdf). Another distinctive aspect is the amount of sensitivity analysis that can be run. The scenario analysis first contains a control panel to regulate the length of the analysis and what will be displayed. After the initial scenario is set out, there are several variables including multipliers and growth rates that the user can input. The student can quickly analyze the results under summary data which will display key metrics and charts for that scenario. This allows for running various feasibility analysis in a quick and efficient manner. After all calculations have been run, a summary section outputs results, ratios and charts for the key data required for communicating results. This data can be viewed as an aggregated total under the consolidated section or as individual segments as required by decision makers.
