In this repository, I share a comprehensive teaching framework for assessing how much we are paying for growth in a portfolio of stocks. In particular, with the GROWTH_WORTH_FORMULA_FUNC function I trace earnings growth back to two forces: investment in new assets, and improving efficiency on existing assets. Students can use this function to understand the decomposition of growth to examine both historical growth rates in earnings across the same firm (or multiple firms) and the link between value and growthâ€¦with some firms adding value as they grow, some staying in place and some destroying value.
