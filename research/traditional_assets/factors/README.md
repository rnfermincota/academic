My experience is that students find these accounting adjustments at the outset and struggle to get through them. The technical report first gives an explanation of how each adjustment fits into the valuation model as a whole and then gives detailed explanations of all accounting formulas and calculations in plain English. With its intuitive nature and the technical report as guidance, students are able to forecast how much cash Apple, for example, have available for stock dividends & buybacks. In class, I provide detailed examples, work through the assumptions and approximations, and for those interested, code to automate the calculations.
