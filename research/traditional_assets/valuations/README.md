After more than two decades of disruption, it is quite clear that center of gravity has shifted for both economies and markets, with the bulk of the value in markets coming from companies that are very different from those that dominated the 20th century. While much is made of the fact that some of the biggest companies of today's markets (in market capitalization terms) derive their value from intangible assets, we think the bigger difference is that these tech companies are also less capital intensive and more flexible. That flexibility, allowing them to take advantage of opportunities quickly, and scale down rapidly in the face of threats, limits downside and increases upside.

Value investors are facing one of the most challenging investing landscapes in history. The shift in economic power to more globalized companies, built on technology and immense user platforms, has made many old-time value investing nostrums useless. Now value investors have to leave their preferred habitat (mostly mature companies with physical assets bases) in the corporate life cycle to find value. One of the biggest issues with old-time value investing is that it viewed and continues to view uncertainty as something to be avoided as much as possible, and takes the view that they cannot value businesses, where there is too much uncertainty. That view has led investors to focus on mostly mature companies and kept them out of investing in tech companies. Unfortunately, value investors are born pessimists, and they believe that making bets on the future and/or paying for growth is a sign of weakness. This is, of course, the mirror image of the investor's lament that a tech company cannot be valued.

The debate about tech valuation is interesting on many dimensions, but one that is worth focusing on is how much growth is worth (https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/main/research/traditional_assets/growth-worth), and what we are paying for it. As Bill Gross recently wrote “stocks may decline based on disappointing earnings growth, not higher interest rates”. But there are some investors who argue that growth is speculative and that it is worth very little or nothing. At the other extreme are those who argue that growth is priceless and that we should therefore be willing to pay for it. Even though both groups seem to be in agreement that valuing growth is pointless (mainly because it requires estimates that will be wrong in hindsight), we believe that it is not growth that we should be paying a premium for but quality growth, with quality defined as the excess return generated over and above the cost of capital. 

Picking stocks with high return on invested capital and avoiding those without earnings was a simple, yet extremely effective, way of outperforming in 2022. Luckily for us, we have an equity portfolio of value-creators and price-setters, with set investment objectives and risk limits (https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/systematic_position), rebalancing regularly, making tactical shifts when the risk premium changes (https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/sp500_monthly_valuation), and exploring the entire investment universe for top quality companies with solid cash flows. Within selected countries and sectors (https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/tour_world_economies_businesses) we only own companies that can (i) invest capital at significantly higher returns than their cost of capital (value creation), and (in) raise prices without impacting demand (price setting). Returns on capital must be high, consistent and unleveraged, with competitive advantages, ideally switching costs and network effects, preventing returns and margins from being competed away.

According to Buffett, the key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. Pricing power, always a positive for companies that can sustain it, may be a crucial competitive advantage in the year ahead. Inflation has surfaced across many global economies, and there are signs that it could linger in the coming months. Rising costs can erode a company's profit margins and, ultimately, investor returns. But companies with clear, sustainable pricing power can protect their profit margins by passing those costs along to customers. As a friend once told me: "compounding is just returns to the power of time. Time is the exponent that does the heavy lifting, and the common denominator of almost all big fortunes is not returns, it is endurance and longevity."
