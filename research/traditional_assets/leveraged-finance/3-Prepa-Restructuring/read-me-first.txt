Few years ago ago I wrote a teaching module on the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) restructuring plan. PREPA remains one of the largest of the commonwealth’s unrestructured obligations despite the availability of a restructuring agreement that eliminates billions in payments to creditors and that supports a set of reforms needed urgently. The essence of the plan was to lower the public power agency’s debt by about $1.4 billion by securitizing the obligation. Bondholders would get restructuring bonds in place of current revenue bonds. This module (http://www.rnfc.org/courses/finance/modules/restructuring/) evaluates options available to lenders and investors in benchmarking the likelihood of recovery against other alternatives and determine the current market prices of the company’s debt.
