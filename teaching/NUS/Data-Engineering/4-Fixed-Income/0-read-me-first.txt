Digitization has been a consistent theme in the global trading world over the past decade plus, albeit a slower shift in the bond markets than other areas. Behaviour has changed in fixed income markets for good. The coronavirus pandemic prompted a rapid shift to electronic trading platforms in the bond market, as bankers and investors were unable to access their sprawling trading floors for months, they sought out new means of transacting. In 2022, the global bond market totaled $133 trillion. Valued at over $51 trillion, the US has the largest bond market globally, China is second, with $20.9 trillion. Several governments and major banks around the world are now engaging in the development of fully functional digital bond markets. Managing a bond portfolio is a difficult task due to the numerous risks associated, which include but are not limited to interest rate risk, credit risk, market liquidity risk, and diversification risk. Interest rate risk directly reflects the yield received by the traders, whereas credit risk, market liquidity risk, and diversification risk play a vital role in the traders' risk management framework. Hence, assembling the building blocks necessary to streamline the workflow of a bond trading desk while assisting investors and traders in conducting informed decisions on whether to buy or sell a particular bond and increase the visibility of the risks associated is a fantastic opportunity. Currently, bond traders have to send prices for a large number of bonds to several different trading venues, each with its own user interface. It seems the goal for Moment is to minimize the minutiae of pricing all of the bonds combined with advanced execution functionality specific to the bond market in a suite of APIs.
