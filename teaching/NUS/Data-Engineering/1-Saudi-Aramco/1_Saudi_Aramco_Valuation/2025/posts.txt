Saudi state oil producer Aramco reported on Tuesday a decline in net profit to $106.2 billion in 2024, down from $121.3 billion in 2023. The company said it expects total dividends for 2025 of $85.4 billion — a significant fall from 2024′s total of $124.2 billion. Here is the updated valuation for Saudi Aramco using the equally weighted valuation model: Dividend Discount Value, FCFE Value and the FCFF-based Value of Equity. At the wrong price, 124% price ($1.717T) as of value ($1.398T), there is no good time to buy. But at the right price, I would buy shares of Aramco in any setting or at any time. Saudi Aramco is one of the most profitable company in the world, with almost unassailable competitive advantages. Highly recommended to read their latest annual report available online via their website.
