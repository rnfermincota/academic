Applying some brain gesticulation to infrastructure modeling

Excellent job on vectorizing the water utility’s policy simulation model: https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/ppp_water_utility

In most cases the processes involved in converting the for loops into functional(s) did not behave in the way we originally thought. This meant you had to conceptualize when the relationship between elements was not independent, or was defined recursively, and then vectorized that understanding. You therefore had to overlay theoretical knowledge with pragmatic common sense. 

Next step would be to review Rami Krispin’s tutorial for deploying flexdashboard on Github pages with Docker and Github Actions. Looking forward to replace the results spreadsheet with a flex dashboard.

P.S. I have taught some financial models and data engineering methods I have developed during ten+ years of experience in private markets investing. My experience is that younger data scientists find real estate and infrastructure investments difficult to model and struggle to get their arms around the formulations. In the repository below, I provide technical reports, work through the formulas and, for those interested, code to automate some of the calculations: https://github.com/rnfermincota/academic/tree/main/research/real_assets
