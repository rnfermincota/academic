Getting my NUS students ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬ up to speed with everything they need to know about F1

[1] F1 Ergast DB with SQLite and dplyr: https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/f1_db
In this lecture, I covered how to create a SQLite database image version of the Ergast Developer API containing historical Formula 1 racing data. I also discuss how to use the dplyr package to interface with databases and to make window functions available to SQLite files.

[2] F1 Records with SQLite and dplyr: https://rpubs.com/rafael_nicolas/f1_queries
In this lecture we reconstructs all dplyr F1 queries, then compares them with the SQL related queries. Students will check if the dplyr output matches using sql statement. For each section, we will repeat this checking process.
