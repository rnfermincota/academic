What I like about the M competitions (https://lnkd.in/e8BHfbgm) is that they are free and open project where NUS students can explore and decide what they would like to do. Like the real world, students can choose to approach the M5 competition (final project) anyway they deem fit as long as the results are satisfactory. For the final project all I require is prediction for at least N time series and at least one model. Diverse models in an ensemble are better than one model, especially when students use multiple time series. For example, with the submission attached, the group of students invested a significant amount of time in the modeling process and slaughtered other teams in terms of accuracy. I also believe the work submitted by this group is able to compete against some of the participants that joined the M5 competition. Students are also free to introduce external factors such as CPI and weather data to verify whether these factors affect Walmart sales. Thinking from the perspective of the target (if possible) is a crucial skill of data scientists. Students are also encouraged to explore features that can be helpful by putting themselves in Walmart consumers' shoes. For instance, the delta of the product price compared to last week are excellent features to consider. Some features are very useful in selecting an optimal subset of models from all individual models without the need to run all possible combinations of individual models. Further, since students are dealing with a sheer number of features, they can approach it in two ways. The first method is to speed up the process, and this usually can be done via parallelization (https://lnkd.in/ez3r8mqz). The second method focuses only on the valuable data and invest their time in the feature engineering and modeling process. Of course, these two ways are not mutually exclusive. Doing both would help each student reach the optimal state. Last but not least, in class students are encouraged to use the Modeltime package (https://lnkd.in/gv5MMDg), which is a well-organized ecosystem for time-series processing, modelling and generation of forecasts. Students are also encouraged to join Matt Dancho (Business Science)â€™s online course DS4B 203-R: High-Performance Time Series Forecasting (https://lnkd.in/eyPXtu3P), which is an amazing course designed to teach Business Analysts and Data Scientists how to reduce forecast error using state-of-the-art forecasting techniques (https://lnkd.in/eUA3Gpn).
