'ROW 27: RETAINED EARNINGS; Retained Earnings: When a company starts out
'it only has paid in capital as part of shareholder equity. By this is
'meant the dollars paid to the company by shareholders to obtain shares
'(not via a public market like the NYSE)but like in an IPO. Thus retained
'earnings would be zero. But as the company grows and makes a profit the
'retained earnings will generally grow, unless reduced by paying dividends
'or other expenditures, and especially in mature companies retained earnings
'will become a larger percentage of shareholder equity.

'Edgarscan online) and add up CEO's Salary,Bonus, and All Other compensation.
'Input in Millions of dollars. Do not include long term compensation or
'stock options
'ROW 37: STOCK OPTION GRANTED SHARES(M); Annual report notes will list
'Stock Options outstanding at the close of the fiscal year of the report.
'Input in Millions of shares.
'ROW 38: NET INCOME IF STK OPTIONS EXPENSED($M); "Net Income if Stock
'Options Expensed" (input in millions of dollars). Look in the footnotes
'of the Annual Report or 10K for a section on "stock based compensation"
'that starts out with the "Net Income as reported" (same value as on the
'Income Statement) and then subtracts the "Pro forma employee compensation
'cost of stock based compensation plans." The Net Income if stock options
'are expensed will be labeled "pro forma". The new law is that all must
'be expensed. If the difference is between Net Income Reported and the pro
'forma amount is too great, they have been using your company as a personal
'piggy bank and usually try to buy back stock so the shares are not too
'badly or noticably diluted.

'% Return on Equity (ROE) = (net profit / average equity) x 100 The rate of
'profit the company earns on the stockholder's equity entrusted to management to
'use. In this case, the equity is calculated by averaging the equity at the
'beginning and end of the fiscal year. ROE is also useful to look at to determine
'how much internally generated return on capital is generated to finance future
'growth. Percent Return On Equity is useful in measuring the "efficiency" of management
'compared to competitors. Since the ROE is a key factor in the growth of the company's
'earnings, breaking it into its 3 components allows us to analyze the sources of
'earnings growth and their trends. ROE = (net profit / sales) X (sales / assets) X
'(assets / equity). We do not calculate ROE this way, but use this fact to examine
'the year to year trend of each component on the ROE trend. Component No. 1 (net
'profit / sales ) is the Net Profit Margin described earlier. Component No. 2
'( sales / assets ) is called the Asset Turnover (Efficiency
') Is how efficient and intensively is management utilizing the assets of the
'company. Check when significant changes occur from year to year.. Component
'No. 3 (assets / equity ) is called Financial Leverage (Gearing) or Balance Sheet
'Leverage. From our discussion of Assets and Equity above, we can write:
'(assets / equity) = (assets / (assets - liabilities) Note that Increased debt
'increases both the assets and the liabilities, so the denominator is not significantly
'changed, but the numerator goes up. Therefore increased Debt increases the Financial
'Leverage directly assuming other changes in the balance sheet are relatively less
'significant. However, be aware that the higher the leverage with increased debt,
'the higher the Return on Equity might be, but also the higher the risk. Some leverage
'can increase the returns to the shareholders, but increased debt leverage increases the
'risk of failure and/or bankruptcy. In comparing the year to year changes in Financial
'Leverage and ROE, one should also note the increased percentage of debt. An increase in
'assets due to more debt will raise Financial Leverage, but will tend to lower Asset
'Turnover unless an offsetting increase in sales is made. Note: The three components of
'Return On Equity are usually printed out on the Output worksheet on the three rows
'immediately above the Return On Equity. But Components No.2 and 3 of these 3 rows have
'been hidden in this spreadsheet in order to keep it simple. If you want, you can unhide
'these values.

'In comparing the data between banks, the comparisons should also be made:
'1. Over a couple years time for a given bank 2. Only between banks in a given
'peer group. (i.e. Compare credit card companies to their peers; small regional
'banks to their peers, etc.) Recall that Assets - Liabilities = Equity Keep in
'mind that as the bank grows, all parts of the equation must grow as well.
'Larger banks will tend to have a large amount of investment securities as
'well, although loans will likely be the majority asset in most all banks.

'INCOME STATEMENT There is nothing complicated about understanding banks;
'you just have to be familiar with the language they use and how their
'business is conducted. IT IS QUITE DIFFERENT! Their "Operating Revenue"
'consists of Net Interest Income from loans PLUS Non Interest Income from
'fees, etc, MINUS a Loan Loss Provision (or LLP) for anticipated bad loans
'PLUS a Tax Equivalent Adjustment (or TEA) used to adjust tax exempt income
'up to a pre tax level based on the overall corporate calculated tax rate.
'(In many cases, the Net Interest Income is already adjusted for any tax
'exempt income (It may say "taxable equivalent", possibly in a footnote).
'In this case, for the Tax Equivalent Adjustment, you may input a zero. If
'it does not say, look in places like the Management's Discussion and Analysis
'or tables that may give the Tax Equivalent Adjustment, or calculate the Net
'Interest Income with and without the added TEA. The SEC does not allow the
'Net Interest Income that appears in the Income Statement to include the
'TEA So to restate: Operating Revenue= Net Interest Income before Loan
'Losses LLP + Non Interest Income -LLP + TEA. That was the Income. Now for
'the expenses: You have the Total Interest Expense and Non Interest Expense
'(more properly called "Other Expense") Total Interest Expense consists of
'interest that the banks have to pay out for deposits, other borrowed money,
'and long term debt. Non Interest Expense (or "Other Expense") consists of
'Salaries, benefits, Occupancy, furniture and equipment, Office, Audit and
'regulatory fees, marketing, and other. Notice these are almost fixed fees
'that are the cost of doing business . Non Interest Expense is NOT tied to
'Non Interest Income. Mentally connecting these terms causes a lot of confusion.
'Many banks therefore PROPERLY call Non Interest Expenses "Other Expenses" and
'call Non Interest Income "Other Income." Lets talk about Loan Loss Provisions
'(LLP) on the Income Statement: On the Income Statement and Balance Sheet, we
'like to compare the current year (CY) with the prior year (PY) for the Loan
'Loss Provision which the banks set aside for anticipated bad loans. A bank
'may decide to set aside more money for LLP this year relative to last year
'because IN MANAGEMENT'S JUDGEMENT they have doubts about the collectability
'of the loan portfolio due to factors such as the nature of the portfolio,
'trends in loss experience, economic conditions, etc. Since LLP affects the
'calculation of Operating Revenue (as we have seen above) , yet is subjective,
'LLP has to be accounted for somewhere along the line from year to year. An
'overly big LLP takes away from reported income at year end, and an overly
'small one adds to reported income, but with a price to pay later as we will
'show. It could only be that management is being conservative, not necessarily
'actually be faced with big losses. Where it is that management has to "pay
'the piper" for a bad guess one way or the other? That is where the LOAN LOSS
'RESERVE (LLR) comes in. It is analogous to a "kitty" that management either
'contributes to at end of the year if they made the LOAN LOSS PROVISION too
'high; or takes funds out of it if they made the LLP too low. Obviously a
'bank is in a more conservative position if they have a BIG loan loss reserve
'(LLR) as a percentage of loans. The loan loss provision is an item on the
'Income Statement. The loan loss reserve is on the balance sheet. If a bank
'used more money to cover bad loans than was set aside in the LOAN LOSS
'PROVISION, that deficit would be taken out of the LOAN LOSS RESERVE account.
'If they used less, the surplus is added to the LLR. The bank doesn't want to
'be over reserved, because putting too much money aside to cover bad loans can
'take away from other businesses. On the other hand, if a bank is under-reserved,
'it can get caught by surprise by bad loans, and be forced to take a charge
'against earnings. Regulatory agencies can require that a bank set aside
'additional amounts in the LLP and LLR. Net Income is defined the same as for
'any other business. It is what is left over after subtracting from the
'Operating Revenue all the various costs of doing business and all the taxes.

'Be sure you input the Net Interest Income before Loan Losses, because the
'computer will subtract out the loan losses, which are called input the "Net
'Interest Income Before Loan Losses because the computer will subtract out
'the loan losses, which are called the Loan Loss Provision (LLP). The provision
'for loan losses will be input for the Current Year CY and for the Prior Year
'PY, right next to it. The Total Non Interest Income and Total Non Interest
'Expense are sometimes called "Other Income" and "Other Expense", respectively.
'After inputting "Net Income", you are done with the Income Statement.

'
'CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET The Total Investment Loans are THE major part
'of a bank's Assets. It is the source of most of their income. Loans are
'Assets. Deposits from the bank customers on the other hand are the major
'part of the Liabilities. We like to see the Loans increase from prior year
'(PY) to current year (CY) by a substantial percentage as well as the see
'the deposits grow which provide the funds for the bank to make loans. Total
'Assets include the loans, which as we said are a major part of the Assets.
'The cash and cash equivalents of the bank plus the bank premises and other
'assets make up the remainder of the Assets. We also like to see Total Assets
'grow from PY to CY. In calculating the Return on Assets, we divide Net Income
'by the Average Assets from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
'Total Stockholder's Equity is the Total Assets minus the Total Liability.
'We input this for both the CY and PY so that we may calculate the return on
'Average Equity from the beginning to the end of the year.

'The Total Investment Loans for current year CY and prior year PY, right next
'to it, are often called by other names such as Loans, net of unearned Income
'or Loans and Leases, or Total Loans. Next, you will need to input Total Assets
'for the Current Year CY and Prior Year PY. right next to it. Near the bottom
'of the page, input Shareholder's Equity for CY and PY. Also called
'Stockholder's equity

'SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA: (as available) No need to look for Tax Equivalent
'Adjustment if the Net Interest Income is defined as "taxable equivalent".
'In that case, it has already been added in to Net Interest Income, so we
'input zero for TEA. If it is not said whether the Net Interest Income is
'a "taxable equivalent", then we have to find the TEA from other sections
'of the annual report. The next three items are taken from either the
'Valueline or from the Annual Report Selected Financial Data section or from
'the 10K. They are not always easy to find, or may be using different
'terminology. I prefer to get Non Performing Assets as a % of Loans, Net
'Charge Offs as a percent of average loans, and Loan Loss Reserves as a %
'of loans from the Valueline first for most convenience, then from the
'Annual Report. This input to the spreadsheet is merely reprinted on the
'output sheet. The first two should be less than 1% and as small as possible.
'Loan loss reserves can and should be higher at typically 1 to 2% or more to
'be conservative. Non Performing Assets as a percent of Total Loans means Non
'Performing Loans. (Remember Loans Assets are non performing loans (Loans are
'one type of Assets.) Unlike LLP which is POTENTIAL bad loans, Non Performing
'Assets are ACTUAL experience with bad loans. Non Performing Assets are loans
'where the interest is past due for over 90 days or more; loans that are not
'being paid on schedule; or loans that are being paid at a reduced rate. The
'lower this ratio, the better. It shows that the bank is keeping its bad loans
'under control. Keeping this ratio under 1% or lower is normal. Net Charge Off
'as a percent of average loans is calculated as follows; Net Charge Off =
'(Loans written off - Collected Bad Loans) / Average Total Assets. This is
'apparently the case where some loans may eventually be collected and some
'must be written off as hopeless. The net charge off ratio should also be
'less that 1%. For this number to be positive, as it apparently is, obviously
'the loans written off are larger than the Collected Bad Loans. Actually
'collecting on part of the loans keeps this number down. Loan Loss Reserve
'as a % of loans. This is the "kitty" where the bank goes to get funds when
'they had more bad loans than were estimated in the Loan Loss Provision. This
'number is usually well over 1% and ranges from 1 to 2% normally. The higher
'numbers are more conservative. The loan to deposit ratio is either found or
'can be calculated from the annual report and allows you to see where the
'bank gets its funds needed to finance its loaning activities. If this ratio
'is greater than 1, the bank deposits may not be sufficient to support its
'loaning activities. If this ratio is less than 1, the bank may not be fully
'using its deposits as a profitable source of loans. However anywhere from 60
'to 110% is not abnormal, with smaller banks having a smaller loan to deposit
'ratio. Lower is considered to be better. A trend toward larger ratios with
'time indicates higher leveraging without depositor support. Real Estate
'Owned, called REO or OREO, is foreclosed property. The input is in millions
'of dollars. On annual report it is sometimes called Other Real Estate Owned,
'hence OREO.

'The only remaining green shaded line that must be filled in here is the Tax
'Equivalent Adjustment or TEA. This is an adjustment which takes into account
'that some of the bank's assets are in tax exempt securities, and it adjusts
'that interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Many annual reports
'have already added in this adjustment into their statements and report their
'figures as "taxable equivalent". If this is the case, we input a zero on this
'line. If it does not say, you may have to look into the 10K or the footnotes,
'etc to find out. When a bank has many tax exempt securities, this will not
'be negligible. So if it does not say, you will have to search for the TEA.
'The remaining data in this section are optional but highly desirable input
'that are available in Valueline and/or the annual report. The data as input
'are merely output again. In some cases, the data such as loan loss experience
'are color coded (e.g. green, yellow or red) depending if the numbers are
'better or worse than desired.

'NET INTEREST MARGIN: This definition can vary between many banks. The
'definition we are using is: Net Interest Margin NIM = (Net Interest Income
'before LLP - LLP) / Investment Loans CY. The Net Interest Income before the
'Loan Loss Provision (LLP) is from the Statement of Income, immediately followed
'by the Loan Loss Provision (LLP) which must be subtracted. Investment Loans for
'the current year (CY) are located on the Balance Sheet (under Assets). Investment
'Loans are also called by names such as "Loans, net of unearned Income" etc. The
'Net Interest Income is the difference between interests earned from loans minus
'interest paid to depositors. A Loan Loss Provision is then subtracted to determine
'the "keepable" part. It is then divided by Investment Loans for the current year.
'In other words, NIM is how much money you are making from interest income as a
'percentage of the Loans made. This parameter combines the measurement of two
'things: The difference between interest earned on loans and interest paid to de
'positors as well as how profitable this difference is relative to the Total Investment
'Loans that exist. This is a very closely watched measure of how well a bank is doing.
'If interest rates go up or down, this measure would not be affected as long as the
'difference between interest made on loans and interest paid to deposits move up or
'down together. A bank examiner on the I Club List in 1998 said that a bank with a Net
'Interest Margin of 4.5 to 5% was in good shape. We have color coded between 4.5 to
'5% as being yellow. Greater than or equal to 5% was coded Green. Less than or equal to
'4.5% was coded Red. ( It is not important if you agree on color coding limits, just

'Average STOCKHOLDER 'S EQUITY / AVG. TOTAL ASSETS (OR CAPITAL RATIO) Peter
'Lynch, in his book, "Beating The Street" Chapter 12 & 13 on banks, considers
'this ratio to be the most fundamental measure of financial strength. Before he
'invests in any bank, he likes to see this ratio to be at least 7.5% He discusses
'it in great detail as applied to banks he considers buying. The Capital Ratio =
'Avg. Stockholder's Equity CY / Avg. Total Assets CY (expressed as a percentage);
'where Average Stockholder Equity (CY)= (Stockholder Equity CY - Stockholder
'Equity PY) / 2.0 ;where Average Total Assets(CY)= (Total Assets CY - Total Assets PY)
'/ 2.0 Federal institutions require banks to maintain a minimum level of equity-capital.
'If a bank increases its level of risk, it should increase its equity as well in order
'to absorb unanticipated losses and protect depositors. The major capital adequacy ratio
'is the above defined Capital Ratio. For observations of typical Capital Ratios, between
'8 to 10 percent is considered good (co or coded green 5.5 to 7.5% is considered good
'(color coded yellow); and greater than or equal to 10% is very good (color coded green).
'Less than or equal to 8%, we 7.5% is considered very good (color coded green). Less than
'5.5% is color coded Red. However Federal Banking agencies permit lower, but we suggest,
'in this case, reviewing the Regulatory capital section of the Annual Report / 10K to
'investigate further what they have to say. If this ratio increases over time, it means
'that the bank is taking less risk, and conversely if it decreases, more risk. Federal
'banking agencies set minimum capital requirements in several categories such as Total
'Risk Adjusted Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Tier 1 Leverage Ratios. The actual definition
'of each category is not important here, but it should be noted that Federal regulators
'could raise the minimum requirements. Depending on a banks's capital adequacy, the bank
'can be placed into a regulatory category ranging from well capitalized to critically
'"undercapitalize". Classification in the undercapitalized categories can have a material
'effect on the bank's operations. For instance, the minimum regulatory capital requirement
'for a bank to be considered "well capitalized" would be if it maintained a minimum "Total",
'"Tier 1", and "Leverage" of 10%, 6%, and 5% respectively. It is important to glance over
'the Regulatory Capital section of the Annual Report / 10K to look at trends over time. For
'instance in the Commerce Bankcorp 2001 Annual Report, the bank reported that it would be
'floating a 200 million dollar Convertible Trust Preferred Offering in 2002 in order to
'increase its Capitol Ratio by about one percentage point, thereby putting it about 2 1/4
'points above the "well capitalized" minimum for its "Leverage" Ratio
