Applying Deep Learning to Financial Market Signal Identification with News Data: Discussed how natural language processing techniques can be used for predicting financial markets from news data. By adapting techniques from other natural language processing applications to news data and market signals, predictive models can be built. Due to the large volume of news data available, models must be trained, optimized, and tested using GPU acceleration. We also taught the fundamentals of natural language processing (NLP) as it applies to the generation of trade signals from real-time news data. A dataset of news article headlines was used to train neural networks to predict market direction. We introduced several popular models for text representation including bag-of-words, Word2Vec, GloVe and Doc2Vec. The effectiveness of LSTM, CNN and feed-forward deep neural networks were covered. Techniques for improving training times with NVIDIA GPUs and the cuDNN library were discussed: https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7696_Andrew-Tan_%20FinancialMarketSignalIdentification.pdf
