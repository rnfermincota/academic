GPU Accelerated Machine Learning for Bond Price Prediction: Discussed how GPU accelerated deep learning and machine learning (ML) can be used for accurately predicting bond prices. We highlighted how DNN & GPU accelerated machine learning algorithms aid in reducing the model building and training time. We also mentioned how we used distributed computing using MPI for training several independent learners in parallel. Lastly, we briefly commented on how AVX vectorization & CUDA kernels can be used in practice to reduce the time spent on the data pre-processing and feature engineering stages of the machine learning pipeline: https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2018/presentation/s8655-gpu-accelerated-machine-learning-for-bond-price-prediction.pdf
